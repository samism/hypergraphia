description: Determine the next version, update the marketing site, and run the full release pipeline for Mac or iOS.
---

Cut a new release of Hypergraphia. Mac and iOS ship independently — see `CLAUDE.md` "Versioning" and "Commit message rule". This skill picks a platform, derives the version from that platform's git tag history, and runs the matching release pipeline.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Pick the platform

Ask with `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "Which platform is this release for?"
- header: "Release platform"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - "Mac (Sparkle + optional App Store)"
  - "iOS (TestFlight)"
  - "Both (Mac first, then iOS)"

If "Both", run the Mac flow end-to-end, then the iOS flow. If either platform fails, stop — do NOT auto-continue to the other.

When running "Both", the un-scoped commit range on iOS overlaps Mac's (older commits show up in both `<latest-mac-tag>..HEAD` and `<latest-ios-tag>..HEAD`). If the user already answered "proceed anyway" for those commits on the Mac flow, do NOT re-ask on iOS — inherit the answer. Only ask again if iOS has *new* un-scoped commits that Mac's range didn't include.

### Step 1: Verify prerequisites

Mac flow:
1. `.env` exists at the project root. If not, stop and tell the user:
   "Missing `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in APPLE_TEAM_ID, APPLE_ID, and SIGNING_IDENTITY_NAME."
2. `notarytool` keychain profile `AC_PASSWORD` works. If not, stop and tell the user to run:
   ```bash
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD" --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" --password "<app-specific-password>"
   ```

iOS flow:
1. `.env` exists and contains `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

Both flows:
3. Working tree clean (`git status --porcelain`). If dirty, stop and ask the user to commit or stash.
4. On the `main` branch. If not, stop.

### Step 2: Determine the next version

Pick the tag query and commit filter based on platform:

| Platform | Latest tag query | Commit scope filter |
|---|---|---|
| Mac | `git tag -l 'v*' \| grep -vE '^ios-' \| sort -V \| tail -1` | `^\[(mac\|shared)\]` |
| iOS | `git tag -l 'ios-v*' \| sort -V \| tail -1` | `^\[(ios\|shared)\]` |

Steps:
1. Get the latest tag for the platform (above).
2. Get commits since that tag:
   ```bash
   git log <latest_tag>..HEAD --oneline --format='%s'
   ```
3. **Un-scoped commit guard.** If ANY commit in that range does NOT start with `[mac]`, `[ios]`, `[shared]`, or `[chore]`, stop and list those commits to the user:
   > "Found commits without a scope prefix. Fix with `git commit --amend` or `git rebase -i` before releasing, or tell me to proceed anyway (commits will fall through the filter and may land in the wrong changelog)."
   Use `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion` to ask whether to halt or proceed anyway.
4. Filter commits with the platform's scope regex. If zero commits match after filtering, stop: "No commits scoped to <platform> since <tag>. Nothing to release." (Note: raw-range commits may still exist — they're for the *other* platform.)
5. Apply semver logic to the scoped commit list:
   - Any commit containing `feat:` or `feat(` after the scope → **minor** bump
   - All commits are `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` style → **patch** bump
   - Any commit contains `BREAKING CHANGE` or `!:` → ask the user
   - Ambiguous / no conventional-commit markers → ask via `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion`:
     - question: "Commits since the last release don't clearly indicate the version bump. What version should this release be?"
     - header: "Release version"
     - multiSelect: false
     - options: "Patch (X.Y.Z+1)", "Minor (X.Y+1.0)", "Major (X+1.0.0)", "Custom"

### Step 3: Confirm the version

Confirm before proceeding. Show the tag (`v<VERSION>` for Mac, `ios-v<VERSION>` for iOS) and the scoped commit list. Use `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "Release as <TAG>? Commits included:\n<scoped commit list>"
- header: "Confirm release"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - "Yes, release <TAG>"
  - "Use a different version"
  - "Cancel"

If "Use a different version", ask for the version. If "Cancel", stop.

### Step 3.5: Update the changelog

Changelog file depends on platform:
- Mac → `CHANGELOG.md`
- iOS → `CHANGELOG-iOS.md`

1. Check if the changelog has an `## [Unreleased]` section with content.
2. If `## [Unreleased]` is empty or missing, draft entries from the **scoped** commit list (same regex used above):
   - **Rewrite each entry user-facing.** Don't echo commit messages. Describe what changed from the user's perspective.
   - Bad: "feat: synchronized scroll and fix editor font size"
   - Good: "Editor and preview scroll together so you always see what you're editing"
   - Strip the `[scope]` prefix and any `feat:`/`fix:` markers.
   - Drop entries with no user-visible impact (internal refactors, test harness updates).
   - Keep entries succinct — one line each, no technical jargon.
   - Confirm the drafted entries with `mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion`.
3. Rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date).
4. Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` above it.

### Step 4: Update version strings

Updates depend on platform:

**Mac:**
1. Edit `project.yml`. Update `MARKETING_VERSION` in both Mac-side targets: `Hypergraphia`, `HypergraphiaQuickLook`. Do NOT touch `Hypergraphia-iOS`.
2. Edit `website/index.html`. Update the `class="requires"` line — match the existing minimum-macOS wording, do not hardcode a name:
   ```html
   <p class="requires">v<VERSION> &middot; Requires macOS Sequoia or later</p>
   ```
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add project.yml website/index.html CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "[mac] Update marketing site version to v<VERSION>"
   git push
   ```

**iOS:**
1. Edit `project.yml`. Update `MARKETING_VERSION` in the `Hypergraphia-iOS` target only. Do NOT touch the Mac-side targets.
2. No website edit (iOS isn't on the marketing site yet).
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add project.yml CHANGELOG-iOS.md
   git commit -m "[ios] Update iOS version to v<VERSION>"
   git push
   ```

### Step 5: Run the release script

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/release.sh <VERSION>
```
Handles: xcodegen → archive → export → DMG → notarize → staple → git tag `v<VERSION>` → appcast → push → GitHub Release.

**iOS:**
```bash
./scripts/release-ios.sh <VERSION>
```
Handles: xcodegen → archive → upload to App Store Connect (→ TestFlight) → git tag `ios-v<VERSION>` → push tag.

Let each script run to completion. On failure, report the error and stop. Do NOT retry automatically.

### Step 6: App Store submission (Mac only, optional)

iOS stops at TestFlight for now — no App Store submission step.

For Mac, after the Sparkle release succeeds, ask:
- question: "Sparkle release complete. Also submit v<VERSION> to the App Store?"
- header: "App Store"
- multiSelect: false
- options: "Yes, submit to App Store", "No, skip App Store"

If yes:

#### 6a: Generate App Store copy

Output three blocks as **raw plain text** (no markdown, no code fences) so the user can paste into App Store Connect:

1. **What's New in This Version** — Cumulative release notes for the listing body. Structure:
   - Current release: full bullet list, one per user-facing change (verbatim from the CHANGELOG's current section).
   - Every prior version back to v1.0.0: one line per version, prefixed with `vX.Y.Z — `, summarizing that version's theme in a single sentence. Do NOT repeat every bullet — collapse feature sets into a short list. The goal is a scannable version history, not a 200-line dump.
   - Use `•` bullets for the current release.
   - The release script sets the per-version "What's New" (short form) automatically; this cumulative version is only for the ASC listing body.

2. **Promotional Text** (170 characters max) — One sentence. Tone: confident, no fluff.

3. **Description** — Full App Store description. Structure:
   - Opening one-liner about Hypergraphia
   - "No Electron. No bloat. No subscription." positioning line
   - 4-5 short paragraphs, each with a leading phrase, covering: editing, preview, media/diagrams/math, export, native macOS integration
   - Bullet list of current features
   - Close with "One-time purchase. No subscription."

Label each block so the user knows which ASC field it's for.

#### 6b: Run the App Store release script

```bash
./scripts/release-appstore.sh <VERSION>
```

Handles: strip Sparkle from `project.yml` → archive → export → upload → wait for processing → create version → set "What's New" from `CHANGELOG.md` → attach build → submit for App Review.

On failure after upload, the build is already in ASC — tell the user they can finish manually.

**Recovery from mid-run abort.** The script strips Sparkle keys from `Hypergraphia/Info.plist` at the top and restores them at the bottom. If it dies between those steps (entitlement check fails, archive fails, upload fails, etc.), the working tree is left dirty with Sparkle keys removed from `Info.plist` AND the Xcode project pointing at the App Store variant. Before retrying or running any other build, restore with:

```bash
git checkout Hypergraphia/Info.plist
xcodegen generate
```

Then fix the root cause and retry. A clean `git status` is the signal that recovery is complete.

### Step 7: Push and report

Ensure all commits are on the remote:
```bash
git push
```

Tell the user:
- Platform and version released
- Link:
  - Mac: `https://github.com/Shpigford/clearly/releases/tag/v<VERSION>`
  - iOS: no public release page; direct the user to App Store Connect → TestFlight
- Whether App Store submission was included (Mac only)

## Important Rules

- ALWAYS confirm the version before proceeding
- NEVER run a release script if `.env` is missing or the working tree is dirty
- NEVER skip the changelog update
- NEVER update both `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG-iOS.md` in the same release — one platform, one changelog
- NEVER bump Mac `MARKETING_VERSION` entries during an iOS release (and vice versa)
- If the release script fails, do NOT blindly retry. Report the error and stop. Retry is only okay after the root cause is identified and fixed (e.g., a bug in the script, a missing credential, a stale file). Never retry on an unexplained or transient-looking failure without diagnosing it first.
- The release scripts handle git tagging — do not duplicate those steps
- Un-scoped commits (no `[mac]`/`[ios]`/`[shared]`/`[chore]` prefix) halt the release until resolved
