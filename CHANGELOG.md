- New Settings → Scratchpads tab with retention controls (keep all, delete after N days, or keep newest N)
- New "Default View Mode" setting in Settings → General to open documents directly in Preview

- Smarter chat retrieval finds notes by title and section even when the question doesn't quote the exact words (e.g. "summarize my writing on local-first software" now matches the note literally named that).
- Chat citations show the heading path so you can see which section answered.
- Drop a new note into an LLM Wiki and Clearly proposes where to file it and which related notes should link to it — same diff-sheet review as Capture and Review. Notes are never moved from where you dropped them.
